# Junior Frontend Developer Task

With VueJS (preferably v2.x), create a note taking app (think Google Keep or Apple Notes).

### POC — The app MUST:

- Allow you to create, read, edit and delete notes.
- Require a login to access.

### MVP — The app SHOULD:

- Save created notes and retrieve them on your next visit.
- Allow for more than one user.
    - Users have a username and an individual password.
    (for the exercise's purpose, the passwords can be the same but must be saved individually)

### Product — The app COULD:

- Display notes in a more visual way (post-its or similar).
- Display which user created a note (if possible, show various users "ownership" with more than only their name).
- Allow only a note's creator to edit and delete it.
- Allow a note's creator to make it private.
- Be accessible from a public url.

As this is not a fullstack task, you are free to choose how you store user and notes data. It could be a [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) or similar NoSQL database, local JSON files or anything you feel comfortable with.

The goal is not necessarily to get everything perfectly running. It is however desirable that you at least try and search for solutions to the problems you might encounter in the later steps of the exercise.

An incomplete app is therefore not a disqualifier, as your process might be more interesting than the end result.
